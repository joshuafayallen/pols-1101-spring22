## Civil Rights

.pull-left[

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/civil_rights_gate.jpg")
```


]


.pull-left[

The rights that protect individuals from discrimination by other individuals and government. 

These protections are applied to the federal government, and are applicable to the states through incorporation under the 14th amendment Equal Protection clause. 

“Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”


]


???
Gate analogy: Once again here is the mass populace of people. Here is the government. The gate here stands for civil rights. In this case the government is opening the gate to people that prior to now/then had been denied such rights and freedoms. 

The fight for civil rights spans races, social classes, gender, sexual orientation, religions, political affiliations, ages, disabled, and even veterans. All of these protected classes of individuals have at some point fought for the equality of rights related to the duties of citizenship and opportunities for participation in civic life. 

Most often the expectation or right that is wanted by these individuals is the right to vote.

## Suspect Class


.pull-left[

<gsu-blockquote-red>

Any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting that they are likely the subject of discrimination. These groups generally have strict  or intermediate (if considered quasi-suspect) scrutiny applied to them

</gsu-blockquote-red>

]


.pull-right[
###  Criteria 

- The group has a history of being discriminated against or has been subject to prejudice, stigma, or genuine hostility 

- They are powerless to protect themselves via the political process. 

- They possess a highly visible and immutable trait, that does not inhibit them from contributing meaningfully to society 

- .bold[Protected Classes]: Race, Color, Age, Sex(orientation and gender identity), Pregnancy, Familial Status, Disability, Veteran, and pre-existing medical conditions

]


???

Is a class or group of persons meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an Equal Protection claim alleging unconstitutional discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.

Basically, race discrimination is treating people differently based on their ancestral or cultural characteristics.

Color discrimination is treating people differently based on their skin color, but can occur between persons of different and/or the same race.
