## Political Knowledge

Survey after survey has demonstrated that Americans as a whole are not well informed about politics and public affairs.  Some analysts place most of the blame on the press, which, they say, is more concerned with entertaining its audience than informing it.  Other observers place most of the blame on the public. They point out that there is almost no vital piece of information about a policy issue that is not reported by the media at one time or another. From this perspective, the problem rests with the public’s failure to pay close attention to the news. 

 In your opinion, is the press or the public primarily to blame for the citizenry’s low level of political awareness? What changes in news coverage might improve the public’s level of awareness?

## Regulation of the Media

- The print press enjoys relative freedom from government regulation thanks to the provision of the 1st Amendment 
  - Content can be regulated when questions of libel and slander are brought forward 
  - Must reach standard of ”Actual Malice” 
  - Content can also be regulated sometimes via prior restraint 
- .bold[Prior Restraint]: censorship imposed, usually by a government, on publication of documents or specific information.     - Unconstitutional in the United States except in extremely limited circumstances such as national security. 


???
Remember the media has the right to get stuff wrong

New York Times v. Sullivan – established the standard of actual malice in First amendment standards concerning the press. When discussing/writing/etc. about an individual the press much avoid making statements of malice (knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity) especially against public figures. If such statements are made then the individual has the right to sue/you are not protected by first amendment.  This is partially where the Snyder v. Phelps decision rises from.

RSF) is based on incidents and types of attacks on the media across the world. The RSF classifies this time period as the “age of post truth” and propaganda. The suppression of these freedoms has become especially problematic in democracies. 

The obsession with surveillance and violations of the right to the confidentiality of sources have contributed to the continuing decline of many countries previously regarded as virtuous. The rise of authoritarian strongman in democracies across the world (United States, Poland, Hungary, Turkey, etc.) combined with toxic anti-media discourse (United Kingdom, US, Poland, Chile, and New Zealand) have also led to significant drops in the position of many of these countries.

## Regulation of The Media

- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the government issues licenses and regulates the business and content of broadcast media.
  - Licenses are granted on a 1, 3, or 5 year term for TV 
  - Radio Licenses are 17 year terms

- It is an Independent Regulatory Commission 
  - Members are appointed  by the President 
  - 5 member commission 
    - Chairman (R) and 4 Commissioners (2R and 2D)
    - 5 year terms

???
The FCC’s goal is to regulate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. It was created by the Communications Act of 1934.  It ensures that we all have access to affordable and reliable broadband services, that the market for such is competitive, it promotes growth in industry and technology, promotes a diversity of media, and provides media and communications during emergencies and national crisis.

## The FCC Regulates Broadcast Media through Various Rules

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Fairness Doctrine]
- Rule requiring holders of broadcast licenses to present controversial issues of public importance in a manner that is honest, equitable, and balanced 

- Eliminated in 1987


]

.panel[.panel-name[Equal Time Rule]

- Rule requiring radio and television stations to provide an equivalent opportunity to any opposing political candidate that request it 

  Exceptions : 
- Airing a documentary 
- Talk Shows and News Syndicates 
- Scheduled  “live” newscast or on-the-spot events 
- News interviews 
- Political debates not hosted by the media station  


]


.panel[.panel-name[Net Neutrality]

- Internet service providers and governments must treat all data on the internet the same and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, or website 


]
]

???
Introduced by the FCC in 1949 and suspended in 1987

Where as the equal time rule is concerned with equal access, the fairness doctrine was concerned with making sure broadcasters provided a free and open discussion of public issues. 

The FD requires that stations (1) provide a reasonable amount of air time to coverage of controversial issues of public important, and (2) accord a reasonable opportunity for the voicing of contrasting viewpoints concerning these issues.

Enforced through the license renewal process in which the states were required to document their compliance.

FCC gradually extended the rules of the FD to apply to statements about individuals rather than just abstract issues.  

Thus, when a broadcast included a personal attack on a public figure, the station that aired the attack was required to notify the person who was attacked and offer him or her a reasonable opportunity to respond.
Reagan appointed several new members to the FCC, all of whom were strongly committed to a free market approach to broadcasting.  In 1987 the FCC decided to repeal the fairness doctrine, on the grounds that technological advances had made it possible to accommodate many stations in a given local, making it unnecessary to force stations to present opposing viewpoints. 

The F.C.C. says that the old rules are no longer necessary because the marketplace has changed. According to the official line, new media -- first cable television, then the Internet -- have given the public access to a diversity of news sources, eliminating the need for public guidelines.

## Sources of Media Power

.bold[Agenda Setting]:  The power of the media to bring public attention to particular issues and problems

.bold[Framing]: The power of the media to influence how events and issues are interpreted
  - the  words,  images,  phrases,  and  presentation  styles  that  a speaker  (e.g.,  a  politician,  a  media  outlet)  uses  when  relaying  information  about an issue or event to an audience

## Attitude Formation

$$
\begin{align}
\overbrace{A}^{\text{Attitude}} = \Sigma\overbrace{V_{i}}^\text{Dimensions used to evaluate something on} \underbrace{W_{i}}_{\text{Weight you give to individucal dimensions }}
\end{align}
$$
???
So how do we get our attitudes about issues? When someone asks, what do you think of president Biden? How do you decide how to answer? Well political scientists have come up with a mathematical model which we think best explains the ways in which people form their attitudes?

An attitude is an evaluation of an attitude object

Draw the big head on the board.
Use the example of presidential approval (Obama)

Race 

PartyID

Charisma

Policy positions – ObamaCare, Foreign Policy, Economic Stimulas

Spouse – maybe they like Michelle

$$

- .bold[Frame]: communication that highlights some subset of the possible dimensions to evaluate an attitude object
- .bold[Framing Effect]: Occurs when $W_{i}$ changes
  - Influences the value of the dimension you look at when forming an attitude

Framing – the process by which media encourages viewers to interpret journalistic stories in a particular way. Media can frame stories for the public using selective presentation of facts or specific descriptive language.

## Public Opinion Experiment

Imagine the US is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual respiratory disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. 


.pull-left[

### Program A

200 People Die

]

.pull-right[

### Program B

1/3 probability that everyone is saved. 
2/3 probability no one is saved. 


]


???
An “overwhelming majority” of people chose Program A which saves 200 lives for sure.

An “overwhelming majority” of the group given problem 2 chose Program D. Note that Program A and C are identical in their outcomes as are B and D. The questions are just framed differently. When A was framed as a gain, people chose it; when it was phrased as a loss (as it is in C), people rejected it.
