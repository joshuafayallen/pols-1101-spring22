## What is Government 

A Set of institutions that 

- Endure overtime 
--

- Has **authority over the people** of a specific territory
--

- Authoritatively **makes and enforces laws**


---



---
## Authortative 

.pull-left[
- The ability to issue commands with the *expectation* that they will be followed

- .bold[Legitimate] Authority: A rightful or justified authority to claim authority over another]


.pull-right[

- .bold[Ordinances]: A law made by a city (or municipal) legislature (such as the Atlanta City Council).

- .bold[Statutes]: A law made by Congress or a state legislature

- .bold[Regulations]: Rules made by bureaucratic agencies that have the force of law

Where does the US government derive their legitimate authority to make and enforce laws

## Our Aside on Weber 

.pull-left[

<gsu-blockquote-red>
We have to say that a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory
</gsu-blockquote-red>

]


.pull-right[
### Why Does the Book hate it 

- Emphasis on the *Executive* function of government

- The concept of the  *monopoly* of the use of force 

- Sovereignty



]
???
Can some body remind us what sovereignty is? 

Sovereignty: To have sovereignty is to be the highest authority to rule over a given territory

The book in particular gets huffy about this. Because ultimately the U.S government derives its ultimate authority from the people. The book kind of sees Weber as the state inherently having the ultimate authority. This is not an unfair reading of Weber. There are parts of the same piece that elude to popular sovereignty but it not really elucidated. Conceptually we can kind of think of this difference as like how is the power to use force elucidated

Does this substantively matter for your day to day experience with government? No not really.

## The Collective Action Problem 

.pull-left[
.bg-light-blue.b--blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[

Multiple individuals would benefit from a certain action,  but this action has a cost that makes it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone

## Rule of Law 

## Constitutional Democracy
.pull-left[
<center>
<gsu-blockquote-alt>


Governments, like the United States, that are effectively bound by fundamental laws are called “constitutional governments.”




</gsu-blockquote-alt>
</center>
]

.pull-right[

- **Rule of Law**: The idea that **all** citizens, **including government officials**, are bound by laws

- **Fundamental law**: The federal government is bound by the laws declared in the Constitution. If a statute is in conflict with the law of the constitution, then the statute is considered unlawful. ]

## Constitutional Government 

.pull-left[

<gsu-blockquote-blue> 
If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself

- Madison 

</gsu-blockquote-blue>

.pull-right[

The purpose of constitutional government is to empower and limit its power

Done Through auxiliry precautions 
  - Dependence of the people
  - Checks and Balances

## Design Principles (AOC)

- Confederacy 

- Weak Central Authority

- No Clear Supremacy of Authority 

- Super Majority Required to do Anything

- **No** Direct Authority Over the People

???
The articles of confederation is interesting.  Instead, it only claims authority, and seeks to exercise power, over the state governments. In this sense, the central government in a confederacy is best described as a government over governments instead of a government over individuals

This is kind of bold because if you have done the chapter you know that states could only be requistioned. Which is just fancy for "be asked nicely to pay the federal government" 

The great vice of that the study guide refers to is the first bullet point. Effectively as we have covered the states held so much power that the centeral government could not excercise any of the limited power that it had. If this part of the study guide was confusing it was because it is like a snippet of an entire essay that you could only find if you clicked on an endnote.

## Design Principles of The Constitution

- Federalism 

- Popular Sovereignty 

- Representative Democracy 

- Separation of Powers 

- Small List of Civil Liberties


???
Federalism: Splits the difference  between full unitary or full confederacy 
The early federalism kind of made clearer distinctions over what policy areas should be handled by the Federal gov and what responsibilities were the states. While also making sure there was a clear mechanism between resolving conflicts between state and federal law.


Popular Sovereignty: The book highlights how the constitution has many avenues to amending the constitution. It also highlights that the constitution is ratifyied under the authority of the sovereign people. 

Representative Democracy: the direct enshrinement of the right to elect politicians. While there is some odditites like how senators are elected and how we (still) elect the president. However, this was pretty unique at the time. While who was allowed to do this was severly constrained

Seperaation of powers: This is still a pretty interesting idea. Among the institutions in the US each has some unique authorities, and has the ability to make the others life harder. The original idea was to create branches that were co-equal but were not really meant to be trusted. To ensure that the protections they wrote down were protected

seperation of powers just comes from a dead french guy named Montesquieu.

civil liberties: part of the opposition to the constitution was just how powerful the central government was. To ensure that they had enough support to actually past the thing they had to concede to some anti-federalist systems. Part of this was to specifically guarantee protections for individual rights

## Benefits and Weaknesses 

.pull-left[
### Greater National Authority
Preserves the union

Reduces compliance costs

Provides national public goods

Reduces negative externalities

Protects minority rights

Prevents races to the bottom

]

.pull-right[
### Greater State Authority

Protects liberty

Represents local diversity

Allows for policy experimentation

Benefits from foot voting

Fosters democratic citizenship


]
???
Preserving the union: If we give to much power to the states they start acting like their own mini countries making the union weaker

reducing compliance costs: if we have one set of rules it makes things easier to monitor and there are clearer red lines. Rather than lots of different red lines

negative externalities: stronger national governments are in better positions to monitor and fix market failures. If we remember back to our collective action problem. An externality is: A cost or benefit to someone who did not choose that cost or benefit. In essence it is something that is outside the price but effects the price. The cost of something is lower than it should because the producer is not actually bearing that cost. We will inevitably end up with a lot stuff like pollution because producers bear none of the costs but in essence we all do. Stronger central governments are in better positions to ensure that somebody bears the cost \

Preventing races to the bottom: This is kind of intersting because as we went over there are a whole host of regulations. States use attractive tax packages to get companies to relocate. This brings a whole host of benefits. If you are trying to bring in big tech you get prestige, an influx of higher incomes, a natural demand for more stuff, and lots of capital

## Races to the Bottom

```{r }

vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/3XE5m_meLVw?t=81")

```

??? 
The federal government is in a much better position to bargain vis a vis larger corporations in some respects. States want to keep businesses and jobs within there states rather than in somebody elses state. So they are more willing to make favorable deals. The federal government is primarily concerned about keeping some industries within the US. The threat of exit for some industries are less credible than others. While some politicians rely on certain sectors to provide votes due to the make up of factors in their districts.

## The Phase of Federalism I didn't Cover


- Grants in Aid: money or land provided to state or local governments conditional on meeting federal requirements 

- Categorical grants: a type of federal grant-in-aid that provides relatively strict and specific guidelines on how the state or local government receiving the money must spend it.

- Block Grants: A block grant is a federal grant-in-aid that provides states and/or local governments with significant freedom to decide how to spend the money.

- unfunded mandates: Federal regulatory or spending requirements placed on states that states need to pay for with their own funds

???
Once we move to the great society program lots of federal funds to the state took the form of grant money. The federal government started to use these to get states closer aligned to federal priorities. However, conservatives did not like this because they thought that states should have more public policy power and that the liberal approach to providing funds to the state were coercive. 

One particular example is how the federal government made the drinking age 21 across the nation. States were required to enforce the current drinking age or risk losing out of 10% of federal highway funds. Louisana was like the last state to do this with the Clinton administration threatening to withhold 17 million dollars in federal highway funds.
