???

Definition 

Any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting that they are likely the subject of discrimination. These groups generally have strict  or intermediate (if considered quasi-suspect) scrutiny applied to them



The group has a history of being discriminated against or has been subject to prejudice, stigma, or genuine hostility 

They are powerless to protect themselves via the political process. 

They possess a highly visible and immutable trait, that does not inhibit them from contributing meaningfully to society 

Protected Classes Race, religion, national origin, and alienage.

## Civil Rights

- .bold[Plessy v. Ferguson]

- .bold[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka KS]

- .bold[Civil Rights Act of 1964]

- .bold[Voting Rights Act 1965]:


???
Unfortunately, the Court found that his rights had not been violated by the Louisiana law since the accommodations were equal in quality ( this was not true for other accommodations that the court did not analyze).  Thus segregation law could stand and the doctrine of separate but equal became entirely legal in the United States 


he court accepted the case and in an unanimous decision they found that racial segregation was unconstitutional under the protections of the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause.  

“We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of “separate but equal” has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” 

civil rights act: A federal law that prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, and religion in areas like education, employment, and (privately owned) "public accommodations" such as restaurants, theatres, and hotels


voting rights act: outlawed any state or local barriers that prevented blacks from being able to exercise their right to vote.  Also , it created the “Coverage Formula”
